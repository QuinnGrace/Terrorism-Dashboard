## Conclusions
- Baghdad made up almost 20% of the lives lost
- Terrorist attacks have generally risen over time, with the exception of between around 1997 and 2007 when there was a decrease in attacks
- Explosives and firearms were the most common weapons employed
- The most common subtypes of weapons were unknown types
- The most common types of attack were bombings, armed assualt, and kidnapping
- The Middle East, Africa, and South Asia were the most affected by terrorist attacks
  
## Recommendations
- Focus should be placed on preventing terrorism in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, with a particular focus on Baghdad
- Terrorism prevention should focus on prevention of moving explosives and firearms, since these are the most commonly employed tactics
- High-value targets for kidnapping should receive pre-emptive protection
- Further information should be gathered into the types of firearms and explosives used, as the current data is very incomplete
